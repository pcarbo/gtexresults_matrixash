In this directory, you will find the script to reproduce the results found in Urbut et al.

1) First, download the input data at https://github.com/surbut/gtexresults_matrixash/wiki/mash_gtex_analysis.zip.

2) The script, *MidwayScripts.R* here will help you to produce several sets of files
	
	1)`ms=deconvolution.em.with.bovy(t.stat,factor.mat,v.j,lambda.mat,K=3,P=3)`

produces an object with the denoised matrices for feeding into the *mash* covariance code. The *factor.mat* and *lambda.mat* called within have been produced by SFA and are single rank factors and loadings approximating the empirical covariance.

2)`covmat=compute.hm.covmat.all.max.step(b.hat=z.stat,se.hat=v.j,z.stat,v.j,Q=5,lambda.mat,A=A,factor.mat,max.step=max.step,zero=TRUE)$covmat` 

produces a list of covariance matrices entitled *covmat"A".rds* upon which to base the mixture of multivariate normals. 

3) `compute.hm.train.log.lik(train.b = train.z,se.train = train.v,covmat = covmat,A,pen=TRUE) ##compute the HM weights on training data`

uses the set of randomly chosen genes to train our model and produces a matrix of likelihoods and corresponding hierarchical weights, *pis.rds* which represent the mixture proportions.

4) Finally, `weightedquants=lapply(seq(1:nrow(z.stat)),function(j){total.quant.per.snp(j,covmat,b.gp.hat=z.stat,se.gp.hat = v.j,pis,A,checkpoint = FALSE)})`

produces 6 .txt files containing the posterior means, upper and lower tail probabilities, null probabilites, and lfsr for all J genes across 44 conditions.
